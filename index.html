    <p>I am a software developer from Atlanta, GA. I am fluent in English and Chinese. I have a BA in Political Science and an MA in international Studies. I have experience working with JavaScript and Python. My current Codefellows course (201) will run until March 2022. I'd like to work as a front-end React developer or full-stack JS developer.</p>
